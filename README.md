# Project Architecture

## Overview

This project utilizes a microservices architecture with service registration and discovery facilitated by Netflix
Eureka. The system consists of three components:

1. **Eureka Server:** A centralized service registry for managing the registration and discovery of microservices.
2. **Transaction Service:** The first microservice that registers itself with Eureka.
3. **Account Service:** The second microservice that registers itself with Eureka.

## Components
